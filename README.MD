# Memory Card Game

This is a simple memory card game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game challenges players to find matching pairs of cards by flipping them over.

## Features

- **8 unique image pairs**: There are 8 pairs of cards, and the goal is to match all of them.
- **Card flipping animation**: Cards flip to reveal their hidden image, and then flip back if they don't match.
- **Shake effect**: When two cards don't match, they "shake" to indicate a mismatch.
- **Shuffle mechanism**: Once all pairs are matched, the deck is reshuffled for the next round.
- **Score tracking**: Displays the player's score and provides a reset button to start over.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Markup language to structure the game.
- **CSS3**: Styling and animations for the card flip, shake effect, and overall layout.
- **JavaScript**: Core logic for the game, including card flipping, matching logic, and score tracking.

## Game Setup

1. **Front view (question mark)**: All cards start with a question mark image.
2. **Back view (images)**: Each card has a unique image hidden on the back, which is revealed when clicked.

## How to Play

1. Open the game in your web browser.
2. Click on any card to flip it over and reveal its hidden image.
3. Click on a second card to try and match it with the first one.
4. If the images match, the cards will remain flipped. If they don't, the cards will flip back after a short shake animation.
5. The game ends when all pairs are matched.
6. Press the **Reset** button to shuffle the cards and start a new game.
